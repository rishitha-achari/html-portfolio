<h1>Hey there! I am Rishitha!</h1>
<p>
  I love crafting user-friendly designs, digging into the "why" behind every tap and swipe, and discovering the human stories behind user behavior.
  
  I enjoy working collaboratively with diverse teams to create impactful and delightful UX experiences that push boundaries. 
  
  I am currently a Masterâ€™s Student in Human-Centered Computing at UMBC.</p>
